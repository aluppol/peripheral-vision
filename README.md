# Peripheral Vision

When I was a child I had to train my eyes and mind to increase the range of focused space on the paper that I can catch at once. With time, when you spend most time behind the monitor - the range of vision decreases.  This app allows taking care of that side of the eyesight. You take care of your eyes - you keep your eyesight.

### How to use it?

You see the red dot in the center. Focus your vision on that dot. Now click on each box with a number sequentially - according to the number in the box, by doing that you must keep your eyes on the red dot in the middle. Donâ€™t move your eyes - you must find numbers with your peripheral vision. When you click on each you will see your time. Try to minimize the amount of time spent and maximize the amount of numbers. You can add and remove rows and columns with the buttons. Also, there are buttons to adjust the scale for yourself.
